- []：根据\ref{Multi-task learning}中的研究结果，采用多任务学习模式相比单任务学习在充电量预测上提升了32.54\%。这一显著提升不仅提高了能源利用效率，也为可再生能源的有效替代提供了可能，对推进能源的碳中和进程具有重大意义。
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
